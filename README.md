# MuGomoku
MuGomoku based on [brilee/MuGo](https://github.com/brilee/MuGo), which is a minimal go engine modeled after AlphaGo, but MuGomoku plays Gomoku instead of Go.

## Dependencies
MuGomoku has added a `showboard` command, which will print out the content of game board, thus please used my patched version of [gtp](https://github.com/brilee/MuGo) instead.

## Training Data Format
MuGomoku accepts data encoded in SGF format.

## Usage
For other usage, please refer to the original MuGo's readme.
